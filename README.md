D3 Charts using Covid-19 Live Data
D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents, which is used to create a static SVG chart. It helps to draw various types of charts:
1)  Bar Chart
2) Circle Chart
3)    Pie Chart
4) Donut Chart
5)  Line Chart
6)  Bubble Chart; and many more.This project mainly focuses on Line Charts.A line chart is a type of chart which displays information as a series of dataPoints connected by straight line segments. Each dataPoint has x variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and y variable determining the position of the vertical axis.
Markers are automatically disabled when there are large number of dataPoints. You can override this behaviour by manually setting markerSize to a value greater than zero.
